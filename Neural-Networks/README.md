We implement an artificial neural network with regularization on the Iris data set. 
We use back propagation algorithm with batch learning to train the neural network. 
For optimization we use Newton conjugate gradient method. After training the network
we obtain 98.10% accuracy on the training set and 97.78% accuracy on the test set.
The data set is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris .
