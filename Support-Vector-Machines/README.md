In svm_linear.py, we implement support vector machine with linear kernel to randomly generated data.
To find the penalty parameter C of the error term, we do stratified 10-fold cross-validation.
We find the optimal value of C according to the cross-validation error. We obtain 90% 
success rate on the training set and mean cross-validation score of 90.18%.   The plot of 
the data and the decision boundary is available at:
