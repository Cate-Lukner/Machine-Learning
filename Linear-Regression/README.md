We implement simple linear regression and multivariate linear regression on the salary data, provided at 
http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/#salary

In linear_reg.py, we implement simple linear regression using gradient descent. The variables used are:
1) number of years since highest degree was earned;
2) academic year salary, in thousand dollars. 
We also provide visualization of the cost function in 3D and its contour plot. The image are available at:

About the data:
The salary data is used in Weisberg's book. It consists of observations on six variables for 52 tenure-track professors 
in a small college.
