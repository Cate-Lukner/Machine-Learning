We implement simple linear regression and multivariate linear regression on the salary data, provided at 
http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/#salary
The data used is the salary data consisting of observations on six variables for 52 tenure-track professors in a small college.

In linear_reg.py, we implement simple linear regression using gradient descent. The variables used are:
1) number of years since highest degree was earned;
2) academic year salary, in thousand dollars. 
We also provide visualization of the cost function in 3D and its contour plot. The images are available at:

In multi_linear_reg.py, we implement multivariate linear regression using gradient descent and normal equations. 
The variables used are:
1) number of years in current rank;
2) number of years since highest degree was earned;
3) academic year salary, in thousand dollars. 
We also plot the change in cost function through the iterations of gradient descent. The image is available at:
