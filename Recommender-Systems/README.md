In collaborative_filtering.py, we implement a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering. 
We use regularization and solve the optimization problem by using L-BFGS-B method. The program takes 
movie ratings from a new user as an input and makes predictions for the unrated movies. Ten movies with the 
highest predicted ratings are displayed as top recommendations. The output of the program is 
available at https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11430119/6813994/e62f44e2-d250-11e4-814d-9b1a81be24bb.png

The dataset used is the MovieLens 100k dataset which is available at http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.
It contains 100,000 movie ratings given by 943 users on 1682 movies.
