We implement principal component analysis Seeds Data Set from UCI Machine Learning 
Repository. We normalize the data, project it to 2D spanned by the eigenvectors.
We also recover the projected data back to 3D. The plots of the normalized data, 
the projected data and the recovered data are available at:

The data contains measurements of geometrical  properties of kernels belonging 
to three different varieties of wheat. The data has even features and is available at 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds .
We apply PCA on the data set with three features, namely: 
1) Compactness;
2) Width of Kernel;
3) Asymmetry Coefficient.
