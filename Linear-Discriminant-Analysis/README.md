We apply linear discriminant analysis to Waveform Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
The data set contains 5000 samples from 3 classes. Each sample has 40 features. We compute the within-class scatter
and the between-class scatter matrices and solve the generalized eigenvalue problem. 
We pick the number of the eigenvectors to be used in dimensionality reduction so that 99% of 
the variance is retained. We plot the projected data. The plot is available at:
