We apply linear discriminant analysis to Waveform Data Set from UCI Machine Learning
Repository. The data contains 5000 samples each with 40 features. We compute within-class
and between-class matrices and solve the generalized eigenvalue problem. 
We pick the number of eigenvectors to be used in the projection so that 99% of the variance 
is retained. We plot the projected data. The plot is available at:
